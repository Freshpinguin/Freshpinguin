ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm freshpinguin â€“ a master's student who spends too much time coding, thinking about math, and wishing I had 48-hour days to get through all the cool projects I'm dying to work on.
ðŸš€ A little bit about me:

    ðŸŽ“ Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science, where I get to geek out over algorithms, AI, and everything in between.
    ðŸ“Š Data Science? Yes, please! I absolutely love turning piles of data into insights â€“ or, as I like to call it, "making the matrix of numbers reveal its secrets."
    ðŸ”¢ Maths, Stats, & AI: You know that moment when you solve a problem with a clever algorithm, and it feels like youâ€™ve hacked into the universe? Yeah, thatâ€™s the good stuff.
    ðŸ’» Backend Development keeps my problem-solving itch scratched. There's something magical about making systems talk to each other... in a way that doesn't crash horribly!

ðŸ‘€ What am I up to when I'm not breaking code (or breaking my brain on math problems)?

I'm super interested in being part of small projects, especially startups. If you've got a cool idea that needs an extra brain or a backend wizard, I'm your person! âš¡

Feel free to reach out if you have a project you'd like to collaborate on â€“ Iâ€™m always up for new challenges, wild ideas, and making the world a better (and maybe more efficient) place with tech!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
